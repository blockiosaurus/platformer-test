# Missing Sprites

Sprites that would enhance the game but aren't currently available:

## Character Sprites

- `character_0002.png` - Jumping pose
- `character_0003.png` - Falling pose
- `character_0004.png` - Dashing pose
- `character_0005.png` - Wall sliding pose

## Notes

These sprites are optional enhancements. The game currently uses:
- `character_0000.png` - Idle/standing pose
- `character_0001.png` - Walking/stepping pose

The walking animation alternates between these two frames when the player is moving on the ground.
